# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

## Overview
This project implements **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using Python. ACO is a probabilistic technique inspired by the behavior of ants finding the shortest path between food sources and their colony. The goal of this implementation is to find the optimal or near-optimal route that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the origin city, minimizing the total distance traveled.

## Objective
The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic NP-hard optimization problem where the aim is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the starting city. Ant Colony Optimization is used here to provide an approximate solution.

## Key Concepts
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** is a nature-inspired algorithm that simulates the pheromone-laying behavior of ants to find the optimal path.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a widely studied problem in combinatorial optimization where the task is to visit a set of cities, returning to the origin, with the shortest path.

## How ACO Works
Ants explore paths between cities randomly but lay down pheromones on their paths. Over time, shorter paths accumulate more pheromones, guiding more ants toward optimal solutions. ACO uses this mechanism, combined with local search strategies, to find solutions to TSP.

## Algorithm Steps
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up the cities and their distances.
   - Initialize pheromone levels between each pair of cities.
   
2. **Ant Movement**:
   - Each ant starts at a random city.
   - The ant chooses the next city to visit based on the pheromone levels and a heuristic (usually the inverse of the distance between cities).
   - After visiting all cities, the ant returns to the starting city, completing the tour.

3. **Pheromone Update**:
   - After all ants complete their tours, pheromone levels are updated.
   - Pheromones are deposited on paths that ants took, with stronger emphasis on shorter paths.
   - Pheromone evaporation is applied to prevent the algorithm from converging too quickly to suboptimal solutions.

4. **Iteration**:
   - The process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until a stopping condition (e.g., no improvement in the solution) is met.

## Results
- The solution provided by ACO may not always be the exact optimal solution, but it gives a good approximation in a reasonable amount of time, particularly for larger problem sizes.
- The performance of ACO improves with the number of iterations, and the path converges towards a near-optimal solution.
